!Problem 1. (6 points)
!Write a program which
!a) defines an array to have 100 elements,
!b) assigns to the elements the values 1,2,3,...,100,
!c) reads two integer values in the range of 1..100 (either from stdin or from command line)
!d) reverses the order of the elements of the array in the range specified by the two values.


program iteration
  implicit none
  integer:: n,i
  print*,"Tell me the initial number n_0:"
  read*,n
  do 1,100
  if(mod(n,2)==0) then
	n=n/2
  else 
	n=3*n+1
 
end program iteration
