solution

a) Write an MPI program in which nprocs processes search an array in parallel (each gets a nprocs th part of the elements to search).

The command used is mpirun -np 4 ./a.out.

The ourput is:

Process:0 stopped at local index 47
Process:1 stopped at local index 59
Process:3 stopped at local index 99
Process:2 found it at local index 34
