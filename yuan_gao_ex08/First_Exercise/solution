solution

a) Compile and run the source mpiexample.f90 (or .c) in the package MPI starter kit1. Do the run with processor numbers 1, 2 and 4. As the solution, send the output files.

Answer: 
the processor number can be spicified by 

sbatch -n

I used 

sbatch -n 1 
sbatch -n 2
sbatch -n 4

to run the program. The output I got are in the files 

mpiexample1.out
mpiexample2.out
mpiexample3.out

respectively.

The out script files are contained in 

out_937313
out_937321
out_937322
