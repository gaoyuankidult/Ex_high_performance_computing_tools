   This is a simple example to demonstrate parallel MPI runs on
   alcyone.grid.helsinki.fi.

Compile and link:

	module load openmpi-x86_64

	mpicc -o mpiexample mpiexample.c
or
	mpif90 -o mpiexample mpiexample.f90


Send the batch job for execution:

	sbatch submit_parallel
or
	sbatch submit_parallel_use_scratch


Check out the progress of your job:

	squeue
or
	squeue -u <username>


Ouput goes to files 'out_<job#>' and 'mpiexample.out'.  Check
directory 'output' for output of an example of a successful run.

Use the batch script 'submit_parallel_use_scratch' if your code
doesn't produce large amounts of output. The difference between
'submit_parallel' and 'submit_parallel_use_scratch' is that the first
one creates a temporary folder on the /tmp filesystem of the
computational node. Consequently, the code and its input must be
copied there before running the code and output copied back to the
folder where the job was submitted from.

For runs using more than 12 cores (number of cores in one node) you
have to use script 'submit_parallel_use_scratch' because a node can't
see other nodes' /tmp file systems.
