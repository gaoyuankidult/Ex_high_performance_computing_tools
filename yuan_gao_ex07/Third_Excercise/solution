solution

a) Demonstrate that the compiler has been able to apply the SIMD features in the loop by printing the vectorization report using the option above.

Answer:
The compiler option that I used for compiling is as follows:

gfortran -O2 -ftree-vectorize -ftree-vectorizer-verbose=2 ex03.f90

The output is:

ex03.f90:11: note: LOOP VECTORIZED.
ex03.f90:1: note: vectorized 1 loops in function.


b) Compare the CPU time used with and without SIMD extensions.

I kept some compiler option just for readability.

with SIMD :

gfortran -O2 -ftree-vectorize -ftree-vectorizer-verbose=2 ex03.f90
time consumed
0.13199997

Without SIMD :

gfortran -O2 -fno-tree-vectorize -ftree-vectorizer-verbose=2 ex03.f90
time consumed
0.65999997
