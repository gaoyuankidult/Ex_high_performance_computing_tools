Answer:

The command that I used for the running code

mpirun -np 4 ./a.out 

The output of the program.

recv vector of process 0: 5 10 15 20
recv vector of process 1: 6 11 16 21
recv vector of process 2: 7 12 17 22
recv vector of process 3: 8 13 18 23


send vector of process 3: 5 6 7 8
send vector of process 3: 10 11 12 13
send vector of process 3: 15 16 17 18
send vector of process 3: 20 21 22 23
