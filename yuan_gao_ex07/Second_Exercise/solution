solution

a) Compare the CPU time consumed for these two products. Suitable matrix size is about 1000 x 1000. Test with optimization options -O0 and -O3.

Answer:

Test with -O0 option:

gfortran ex02.f90 -O0 
./a.out

 Time of C = A * B
   7.8599997    
 Time of C = A^t * B
   7.6840000    

Test with -O3 option:

gfortran ex02.f90 -O3
./a.out
 Time of C = A * B
   1.9200000    
 Time of C = A^t * B
   1.9280000
