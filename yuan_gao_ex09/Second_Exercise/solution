solution

a) How does the time taken by mpi_reduce (operation mpi_sum) behave as a function of the number of processes?

The time increase as the number of processors increases. However, we need more data to support this claim. As there are some randomness involved in the measurement.

b) Plot the results and comment your observations.

The time spent in the process of each node increases along with the number of nodes increase. The plot result is in the file time_nodesNo_relation.png.
