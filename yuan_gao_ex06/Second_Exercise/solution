a) Compare CPU times when an array of integers is gone through (a) in the same order as the
elements are stored in the memory.

Answer: 
 CPU Time That Obeys Storage Structure of System(Column-majored) :
  0.24399996 


(b) in random order. Be careful to write the program in such a way that the only difference really is the order in which the array is gone through.

Answer:
 The choose row-majored access to be perform the comparation. Going through the same order as stored in memory really helps the performance.
 CPU Time That Does Not Obey Storage Structure of System (Row-majored):
   1.1680000
